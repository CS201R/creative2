#Creative Assignment 2


For this assignment, you should google for other interesting Jquery and AJAX services.  Find something fun and create a new web page with a creative theme and prepare to present the page in class.

Do not copy another exisiting page!!  This is your chance to be creative and to work with another class member to do something phenomenal.  

You will be graded on the following rubric:

    New - Did you innovate?
    Topic Coverage - Is it within the scope of the current topic.
    Significant - Is it a significant departure from the last assignment?
    Exciting - Is it fun?
    Popularity - The rest of the class will rank you for this part.

The groups for this lab are in the Content section of learningsuite.
